q: What is RFIDIOt?
a: A collection of tools and libraries for exploring RFID technology, written 
in python.

q: Why RFIDIOt?
a: I like silly puns. Also, I'm coming at this from an idiot's point of view: 
I know nothing about RFID tags, and even less about python. As such, I felt a 
complete idiot when I started. :)

q: How can I contribute?
a: Send me patches, info, new tools, coffee, money, drugs and/or loose women.

q: What hardware is supported?
a: So far this works with the ACG serial readers. I use the CF Card model, 
but it should also work with the USB version by changing the serial port to 
/dev/ttyUSB0. You can find more details here:

q: So what exactly is here?
a: Please see http://www.rfidiot.org/documentation.html
